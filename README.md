Computer Architecture Reading List Papers

These are mainly papers from the book:
Readings in Computer Architecture
Mark D. Hill, University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences, Norman P. Jouppi, Compaq Western Research Laboratory, and Gurindar S. Sohi, University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences

I requested Mark for a copy of the CONTENTS and then hunted down those papers on the Internet.  

These papers are here for the use of my students and others who may be interested in Computer Architecture.

I do not own the copyrights for any of these and, as far as I know, I am not violating anyone's copyrights either. 
If you are the copyright holder for any of these and you want me to remove the paper from here, let me know I will comply with it.
If you happen to send out a request to be removed from here, bear in mind that ALL of these papers are available elsewhere on the
Internet.
